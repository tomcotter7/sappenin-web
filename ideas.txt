IDEAS:

  - Consistent styling throughout webpage DONE
  - Change where the notifications are shown, maybe a NEWS tab DONE
  - Search bar on homepage to change current location
    - To do this we probably need to have the current location stored in a state,
      so GeoFirestoreConnect HOC can just access the location.
    - What's the best way to do the users actual location?
      Maybe don't use the actual location for the web app, force the user to search first before continuing.
    - So we could have something that checks if there has been a location searched,
      If not, so 'splash screen'.
      If yes, so main homepage, ??which search bar??
  - Difference between users and business ownners.
    - users
      - map
      - calendar
      - nearby deals
    - owners
      - creation
      - active deals
  - improve on creation screens
  - deals / notifications need to auto-delete after expiration
